              I had been dancing in Popping dance since September 2016. In June
              2022, I moved to Melbourne Australia and started developing the
              other styles such like House dance, Hip-hop dance, Waving dance,
              Comtemporary...etc. Dancing is one of my favorite thing in my
              life. While keep engaging in dancing community, I met many of
              brilliant people from different backgrounds, countries, races and
              religions.

              Also, I had honoured to be invited as Popping dance instructor in
              RMIT "Funkdelics" Dancing club in 2022 and 2023. Although they
              were beginner level class, getting in touch with the new
              generations really brought me many joys and happinesses!

              It is always destress, relax and satisfying to play games! This is
              my another favorite thing! I enjoy the feeling to challenge myself
              in the game and collaborate with my mates to achieve our goals!
