        Challenge #4: CRUD Typescript Tasklist App
      </BlackCenterTitle>
      <span>
        This React Typescript Tasklist/Todo challenge requires you to perform
        CRUD operations with instructions to write clean, reusable, manageable,
        and scalable code. This challenge is different and more challenging than
        the last three challenges you have completed. If you can complete this
        ReactJS Typescript Tasklist challenge independently, you can be easily
        hired as an intern/junior React developer.
