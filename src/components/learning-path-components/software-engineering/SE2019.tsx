            The 4th year of my Bachlor degree was stated from September to July
            2020. In this year, I was mainly focusing on build-up my project. I
            was in-charge with the calculation of drone-searching algorithm. To
            find out how to search the whole map completely and minimise the
            unexpected situation. I decided to operate the drone to circle the
            map until the center of the map.
